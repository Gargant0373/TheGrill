# TheGrill
The page was created as an invitation to the TU Delft Grill. The Grill is an event taking place on a sunny day in Hondenstrandje, Delftse Hout, where people grill, drink beer, and sometimes swim with dogs.

The website is published on GitHub Pages [here](https://thegrill.space)
## Stack
Written in Typescript and powered by React. We use [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as our primary source of components. Any library is welcome if you want to use it, but keep in mind the design style.

## Contribute
To run the website locally, you must run `npm run dev` in the terminal. 
To build the website, run `npm run build`.

All contributions are welcome; it is, after all, an event that is for students.
